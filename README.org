* nx-fruit: Fruit of the day for Nyxt

The fruit of the day has a long and storied history within the Nyxt
community. This package formalizes this grand tradition into a module
which can alert you to the fruit of the day. Simply execute
=fruit-of-the-day= to be presented with a wonderful message about the
fruit we are celebrating!

#+begin_quote
A single fruit grew on that tree, a bright pomegranate
fruit. Persephone stood up in the chariot and plucked the fruit from
the tree. Then did Aidoneus prevail upon her to divide the fruit, and,
having divided it, Persephone ate seven of the pomegranate seeds.

* Installation

Git-clone the repository to your Nyxt extension directory. This
directory is typically located at =~/.local/share/nyxt/extensions=
#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nx-fruit ~/.local/share/nyxt/extensions/nx-fruit
#+end_src

After you've added nx-fruit to a place that Nyxt can find it, it is
necessary to load it in your init file. To do this, it suffices to add
the following:

#+NAME: add nx-fruit to init
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  ,#+nyxt-2
  (asdf:load-system :nx-fruit)
  ,#+nyxt-3
  (nyxt:define-nyxt-user-system-and-load "nyxt-user/nx-fruit-proxy"
    :description "This proxy system saves us if nx-fruit fails to load.
  Otherwise it will break all the config loading."
    :depends-on ("nx-fruit"))
#+END_SRC

Now, upon starting Nyxt, the glory of the fruit of the day shall be yours!
